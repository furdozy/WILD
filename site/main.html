  <br> <br>The Wilderness Information
Link Device (W.I.L.D.) is a communication device capable of
transmitting a texted ASCII message between one user of W.I.L.D. and another.
Using long-range wireless transceivers,
communication across distances measuring several miles in an
outdoor environment and several hundred feet when indoors
is expected. This device serves the
purpose of acting as a simplistic, portable, communication
module that can be used when in emergency situations. Its primary objective
is to act as a device capable of providing messaging
capabilities in areas where cellular communication or networks,
as well as internet access, may not be readily available.
